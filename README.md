# Crypto-Tracker

## Project Description

The Crypto-Tracker is an application that allows the user to search for the currencies they are interested in following. The application presents the user with a list of cryptocurrencies that will show the user the price of the currency, market cap, daily volume, and the up to date price change. I wanted to create a user friendly interface that lets the user navigate, add, view, and delete the currencies they are interested in. The application utilizes MongoDB, Express, React JS,Node JS, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Heroku to allow it to function.
